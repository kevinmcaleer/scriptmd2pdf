### INT. KITCHEN - DAY

The morning sun cuts through blinds, striping the small kitchen with light. A kettle clicks.

@ALEX
(whispering)
We can't keep pretending this is normal.

@JORDAN
We stopped being normal a long time ago.

! CLOSE ON
The kettle switch. It clicks off.

### EXT. CITY STREET - LATER

A bustling street. Car horns. A bus groans to a stop.

@ALEX
I have a plan.

@JORDAN
(skeptical)
You always have a plan.

>> CUT TO:

### INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

Dust floats in single beams from the ceiling lights. Tools hang like bones.

@ALEX
Okay. Step one: Don't freak out.

@JORDAN
(already freaking out)
Too late.

### INT. GARAGE OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Alex pushes open a creaky door. Papers flutter.

@ALEX
Found it.
